# Open-Source-Low-Cost-VentilatorIdea-
Presentation of an idea to build a Low-Cost Open-Source Ventilator to deal with the shortage due to COVID19. 

If India ever experiences an outbreak of any virus like COVID19 is to China then there is a
huge possibility that the epidemic will spread at an exponential rate due to our huge
population and population density. Uneven distribution of ventilators and other medical
devices is another problem we face. Most of the 40000 ventilators in India is concentrated
mostly in urban and metropolitan areas with almost no presence in rural areas or in any
isolated locations.
People of all ages suffer from this problem and if they are not given the right treatment and
ventilator support death is inevitable. By providing a proper supply of ventilators and other
medical devices we eliminate the possibility of people not receiving any treatment. But more
importantly we give people a fighting chance to survive and we may save lives and spare
many families from a lot of grief, which is the goal of all the people involved in the medical
field.
While India may not yet realize the full extent of the problem it faces due to the severe
shortage of ventilators, reports from Italy state that the country had to take a severe decision
of denying its senior citizens medical support because of their low chances of survival. Such
a decision cannot be taken in our country which is why we should work towards developing
the technology of low cost ventilators.
